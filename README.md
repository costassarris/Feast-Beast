# Feast Beast
Street Food Heat Mapping Software on Rails. Shows where the best venues for street food are in London, on a handy heat map, weighted to their reviews!

The purpose of this project was to practice a lot of the techniques/languages/frameworks that we had been practicing over the course. Intially, the project followed TDD well and the tests covered the code completely. However, we had a huge deadline. We simply ran out of time and the following TDD started to prove to slow progress to achieve what we wanted. The main problem being how to test the APIs that we were accessing: namely- Twitter, Yelp and Instagram.

Having said this, it looks good and works (disclaimer)!

## Technologies Used
- Ruby on Rails
- OmniAuth
- Geocode/Google Maps
- Twitter, Yelp, Facebook APIs
- JQuery
